# rockpaperscissors

**How it Works**
The game utilizes TensorFlow for hand gesture detection. You can train your own models and update them in the models directory to experiment with different hand gesture recognition models.

To train your own models, refer to the training directory for sample datasets and scripts. Feel free to build upon the existing models or create new ones tailored to your needs.
